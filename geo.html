    question: "Explain two reasons why stakeholders value mangrove swamps.",
    answer: "•Mangroves may mean the villages/fishing communities/ tourist resorts are more protected from hurricanes / tropical cyclones, as mangroves absorb wave energy and dissipate the force of the storm.<br>•Fishermen value the mangrove swamps due to the habitat and biodiversity / various types of fish for example, prawn fishing in Thailand so they can gain income/profit from their catches.<br>• They provide breeding and feeding grounds for fish<br>• They provide natural filters of run-off from farms and sewage<br>• They potentially help with stabilization of shorelines/prevention of erosion.",

    topic: "Oceans and coastal margins",
    question: "Examine the contribution of conservation areas to the management of oceanic fish stocks.",
    answer: "• Overfishing has led to the depletion of fish stocks (e.g. cod, tuna) and is unsustainable.<br>• Fish stocks have collapsed in some ocean areas, such as the North Sea and Grand Banks of Newfoundland.<br>• Establishment of conservation areas (Marine Protected Areas) to manage fishing, allow fish stocks to recover and protect marine biodiversity. Also, important scientific research is carried out.<br>• Success of MPAs is varied, due to weak regulation and controls, and conflict over ownership and rights in ocean areas. Fishing is permitted in some MPAs; illegal fishing and bottom dredging continue.<br>• Conservation areas may conserve fish stocks for the future, but those who rely on fishing for their food/livelihood may not be in favour in the short-medium term.<br>• Conservation areas may have limited success in protecting fish stocks; other strategies, including quotas and aquaculture, may be required.",

    paper: 1,
    topic: "Oceans and coastal margins",
    question: "Examine the roles of wind and vegetation in the development of coastal sand dunes.",
    answer: "• Wind and vegetation play a vital role in the formation of coastal sand dunes.<br>• Other factors are also important, including constructive wave action, a plentiful supply of sand, wide, flat beaches (which allows the sand to dry out) and strong on-shore winds.<br>• Vegetation traps the sand, and anchors the shifting wind-blown sand, allowing more sand to accumulate.<br>• Over time, more dunes will form in front of the existing dunes and plant succession occurs on the older, inland dunes. The development of vegetation is accompanied by soil formation and a complex ecosystem.<br>• Human activity may destroy vegetation, causing erosion of the dunes. Re-planting of vegetation and restrictions on access for people are important in dune conservation<br>• Wind and vegetation work together in the development of sand dunes.",

    answer: "Weathering from cycles of wetting/drying weakens the rock and makes it more liable to collapse. Accept salt, biological, chemical, or physical weathering but not marine process weathering/erosion e.g. hydraulic action by waves. Other subaerial processes include:<br>• Mass movement<br>• Running water<br>• Wind",

    year: 2023,
    paper: 1,
    topic: "Oceans and coastal margins",
    question: "Examine how the increasing demand for abiotic resources in ocean areas may be a source of international conflict.",
    answer: "• Abiotic resources include minerals, oil and gas (Do not credit biotic resources, such as fish).<br>• Increasing demand for resources below ocean floors is a potential cause of international conflict.<br>• Ownership of ocean areas may be in doubt and contested at the national and international scale.<br>• Management of conflict involves resolving contested ownership, international laws and allocation of territorial rights/limits which may reduce conflict/make conflict less likely.<br>• Stakeholders include national governments and transnational mining corporations, and/or international organizations such as the UN and NGOs. Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3) which examines a variety of reasons for international conflict, and the roles/power of different stakeholders, in different places. Another approach might be to examine the varying perspectives on the effectiveness of management strategies.",

    paper: 1,
    topic: "Oceans and coastal margins",
    question: "Examine why it is difficult to reduce the impacts of hurricanes on coastal places and people",
    answer: "• Hurricanes cause serious flooding in coastal areas, due to both heavy, prolonged rain, and storm surges caused by strong winds. Strong winds may also cause serious damage to buildings and other infrastructure.<br>• Hurricanes are difficult to predict/forecast: timing, tracks and strength. Coastal areas may therefore be unprepared.<br>• Global climate change, and rise in sea levels, may result in an increase in hurricane frequency and intensity, and requires global effort.<br>• Both rural and urban population pressures are increasing on vulnerable coastal margins, many of which are low-lying, and may be below sea-level.<br>• Hurricanes often affect relatively poor countries – they cannot afford to build/maintain adequate defenses against flooding; warning systems may be inadequate; problems of poor communication systems.<br>• Costly and difficult to improve poorly constructed buildings and infrastructure.<br>• Poorer communities may lack resilience and preparation, which are difficult to overcome.<br>• Government and local planning may be inadequate, partly due to unforeseen power of some hurricanes.<br>Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3), which examines processes and systems affecting the level of impacts in different coastal places. Also, the varying power of different stakeholders may be examined. Another approach might be to examine how it can be challenging to reduce impacts over longer time scales.",

    question: "“The most important factor influencing the water–food–energy nexus is climate change.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?",
    answer: "• Responses should show knowledge and understanding of the WFE (Water-Food-Energy) nexus – nexus refers to connections, so candidates should display an understanding of the interactions between two or more elements, whether they are dependent or interdependent. The WFE nexus, therefore, studies the connections between these three resource sectors, whether they are harmonious or conflicting. Responses may outline how changes in one element of the nexus have an influence on one or both of the other elements.<br>• The geography guide gives some emphasis to the idea of resource security, so responses may develop interactions in the form of impacts on resource security. Answers may give some development of these securities – water security is access to safe drinking water and sanitation, energy security is access to clean, reliable, and affordable energy, and food security is access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food.

    answer: "Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1): <br> • Responses should have an understanding of what is meant by the global energy balance – the relationship between incoming shortwave radiation and outgoing longwave radiation. There should also be some recognition that the energy balance has changed over both long and short term. Candidates may refer to specific events such as glaciations, the Little Ice Age, and present-day enhanced greenhouse effect. <br> • Responses should show an understanding of the natural processes that change the energy balance. Comments may refer to orbital variations, solar variability, and volcanic activity. Candidates should link the natural processes to changes in the global energy balance, possibly with reference to specific events. <br> • Responses should show an understanding of human intervention processes and how these processes impact the global energy balance. The increased production of greenhouse gases can be related to industrial development, globalization, trade, agricultural production, and lifestyle changes. This will probably be related to present-day climate change. Some answers may refer to human interventions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. <br> • Responses may refer to the processes operating in feedback loops that alter the global energy balance. Comment could refer to the natural operation of feedback loops involved in albedo changes and methane gas relief but recognize that there is a varying scale of human intervention that instigates and fuels their functioning. <br> • When considering the extent of agreement, candidates could adopt a variety of approaches. Some may review the relative importance of natural/human over time and discuss changing balances over geological/historical and recent time periods. An alternative approach would be to examine the scale of change with reference to short-term events such as volcanic eruptions as opposed to longer time and more global events such as present-day climate change. Some may comment on the integration of natural and human causes of change. Some answers may refer to their actions or non-intervention. <br> Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3) which focuses on the relative role of natural and human processes/actions/intervention in changes to the global energy balance.

    question: "“The growth of the new global middle class is the main threat to the resource security of places.” To what extent do you agree with this statement?",
    answer: "Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1): <br> • Responses should have an understanding of the growth of the new global middle class. This could include a brief review of the reasons for the growth of the new global middle class and comments on the reduction of poverty and increase in disposable income. <br> • Responses may develop a definition of the meaning of resource security as it relates to the ability of people to guarantee the availability of natural resources. Responses may comment on resources per se or examine individual types of resources. <br> • Responses should link the growth of the new global middle class with trends in resource consumption. This will probably take the form of an analysis of how increases in overall and individual demand link to additional pressure on water, land/food, and energy resources. Answers may develop how these pressures operate to cause changes in resource availability in all or some of the identified supplies. <br> • Some candidates may further develop the idea of threat by developing issues associated with the water-food-energy nexus that follow on from the growth of the new global middle class. This could be place-specific and give emphasis to the complex interactions involved. <br> • Responses may examine how other factors may impact upon resource security. Overall population growth will increase the demands for resources and so impact upon their security. <br> • Changing population distribution may put pressure on resources in specific places e.g. migrations and refugees. <br> • Climate change may impact upon the supply of resources. The scarcity of specific resources may lead to competing demands that cannot be met. Some responses may comment on how pressures to cut carbon may lead to pressure on alternatives. <br> • The new global middle class may be a solution to resource insecurity – adopt more sustainable methods of resource consumption such as renewable energy / circular economy. <br> • Political factors may influence resource security either by unrest and access to resources or resources being used as a political weapon. <br> • Some answers may contrast the impact of the new middle class with the established HICs. <br> • Responses may look to specific places as an evaluative approach or comment on how different places change their resource security over time. <br> Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3) which focuses on the relative importance of the new global middle class.

    question: "Explain two ways in which higher temperatures could increase the incidence of health hazards on people.",
    answer: "Increased temperature in some regions increases the incidence of vector-borne diseases [1] carried by mosquitoes like dengue fever and the Zika virus [1].<br>Weather temperature extremes – heat waves cause increased mortality amongst vulnerable populations such as the older generation due to heat stroke/cardiovascular disease. Linked with mental disorders/lower birth weight. Heat waves are also linked to a number of skin conditions such as rashes/blisters.<br>Changes in agriculture could impact food availability – leading to nutritional deficiencies.<br>Increased water temperatures caused by higher air temperature mean that waterborne bacteria and harmful algal toxins will be present in the water at different times of the year or in places where they were not previously threats.<br>Higher air temperatures can increase cases of Salmonella and other bacteria-related food poisoning because bacteria grow more rapidly in warm environments. These diseases can cause gastrointestinal distress and, in severe cases, death.<br>Decreased air quality – raises the levels of ozone and other pollutants in the air that exacerbate cardiovascular and respiratory disease.<br>Higher temperatures lead to increased incidence of cyclones – resulting in health hazards/mortality.<br>Higher temperatures lead to melting glaciers, which cause sea level rise and contaminate water supplies in lowland areas – leads to hypertension, miscarriage, and skin diseases (e.g., Bangladesh).<br>Release of pathogens from melting ice – melting permafrost releases long-dormant diseases (e.g., anthrax in Siberia).<br>Dehydration from increased temperature – can lead to hypertension, cramps, and mental issues.",

    answer: "The position of a team in a hierarchy is shown by its position in that league. The team’s position will go up and down in the league, depending on success, over different timescales. The relative success of a team is partly related to economic power and influence. An example of a national sports league should be clearly identified.<br>Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):<br>• The hierarchy of teams includes: the position of teams in the sports league, their economic wealth, and the value and importance of players.<br>• Teams at the top of a hierarchy, such as in the English Premier Football League, are often located in major urban areas and have a large number of supporters from a wide sphere of influence.<br>• They may attract supporters from a local, national, and international scale.<br>• Teams lower in the hierarchy will attract fewer supporters, mainly from a local scale. They will have much less wealth and power.<br>• Reference could be made to factors such as the role of the media, sponsorship, and advertising in influencing the sphere of influence.<br>Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3) of the statement, recognizing that the economic power of the top tier gives rise to a truly global scale of influence.

    answer: "Patterns of economic activity are influenced by several different physical factors, such as geology, relief, drainage, site (e.g., coastal or riverside), and local climates (which might influence patterns of pollution). Geological factors might include proximity to mineral deposits (mining); areas of low relief might be suitable for industrial and retailing activities and influence the development of infrastructure. Coastal regions may attract port activities.<br>Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):<br>• Physical factors that might influence patterns of economic activity include geology, relief, drainage, site (coastal/riverside), and climate.<br>• Relief is an important factor – low relief is a site factor influencing the location of large-scale industrial or retail activities, which will avoid areas of steep slopes.<br>• Economic activities will also tend to avoid areas of poor drainage/marshland liable to flooding. On the other hand, these areas may be of low economic value and so suitable for extensive industrial activities.<br>• Infrastructure development is also favoured by areas of low relief.<br>• A coastal or riverside location is an important site factor for the development of port-related activities.<br>• Geology may be important – proximity to mineral resources may lead to the development of mining; unstable ground may be unsuitable for urban development.<br>• Local climates, such as the direction of prevailing winds, may influence the location of polluting industrial activities.",
