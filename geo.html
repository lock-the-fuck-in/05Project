    answer: "•Mangroves may mean the villages/fishing communities/ tourist resorts are more protected from hurricanes / tropical cyclones, as mangroves absorb wave energy and dissipate the force of the storm.<br>•Fishermen value the mangrove swamps due to the habitat and biodiversity / various types of fish for example, prawn fishing in Thailand so they can gain income/profit from their catches.<br>• They provide breeding and feeding grounds for fish<br>• They provide natural filters of run-off from farms and sewage<br>• They potentially help with stabilization of shorelines/prevention of erosion.",

    question: "Examine the contribution of conservation areas to the management of oceanic fish stocks.",
    answer: "• Overfishing has led to the depletion of fish stocks (e.g. cod, tuna) and is unsustainable.<br>• Fish stocks have collapsed in some ocean areas, such as the North Sea and Grand Banks of Newfoundland.<br>• Establishment of conservation areas (Marine Protected Areas) to manage fishing, allow fish stocks to recover and protect marine biodiversity. Also, important scientific research is carried out.<br>• Success of MPAs is varied, due to weak regulation and controls, and conflict over ownership and rights in ocean areas. Fishing is permitted in some MPAs; illegal fishing and bottom dredging continue.<br>• Conservation areas may conserve fish stocks for the future, but those who rely on fishing for their food/livelihood may not be in favour in the short-medium term.<br>• Conservation areas may have limited success in protecting fish stocks; other strategies, including quotas and aquaculture, may be required.",

    paper: 1,
    topic: "Oceans and coastal margins",
    question: "Examine the roles of wind and vegetation in the development of coastal sand dunes.",
    answer: "• Wind and vegetation play a vital role in the formation of coastal sand dunes.<br>• Other factors are also important, including constructive wave action, a plentiful supply of sand, wide, flat beaches (which allows the sand to dry out) and strong on-shore winds.<br>• Vegetation traps the sand, and anchors the shifting wind-blown sand, allowing more sand to accumulate.<br>• Over time, more dunes will form in front of the existing dunes and plant succession occurs on the older, inland dunes. The development of vegetation is accompanied by soil formation and a complex ecosystem.<br>• Human activity may destroy vegetation, causing erosion of the dunes. Re-planting of vegetation and restrictions on access for people are important in dune conservation<br>• Wind and vegetation work together in the development of sand dunes.",

    answer: "Weathering from cycles of wetting/drying weakens the rock and makes it more liable to collapse. Accept salt, biological, chemical, or physical weathering but not marine process weathering/erosion e.g. hydraulic action by waves. Other subaerial processes include:<br>• Mass movement<br>• Running water<br>• Wind",

    year: 2023,
    paper: 1,
    topic: "Oceans and coastal margins",
    question: "Examine how the increasing demand for abiotic resources in ocean areas may be a source of international conflict.",
    answer: "• Abiotic resources include minerals, oil and gas (Do not credit biotic resources, such as fish).<br>• Increasing demand for resources below ocean floors is a potential cause of international conflict.<br>• Ownership of ocean areas may be in doubt and contested at the national and international scale.<br>• Management of conflict involves resolving contested ownership, international laws and allocation of territorial rights/limits which may reduce conflict/make conflict less likely.<br>• Stakeholders include national governments and transnational mining corporations, and/or international organizations such as the UN and NGOs. Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3) which examines a variety of reasons for international conflict, and the roles/power of different stakeholders, in different places. Another approach might be to examine the varying perspectives on the effectiveness of management strategies.",

    paper: 1,
    topic: "Oceans and coastal margins",
    question: "Examine why it is difficult to reduce the impacts of hurricanes on coastal places and people",
    answer: "• Hurricanes cause serious flooding in coastal areas, due to both heavy, prolonged rain, and storm surges caused by strong winds. Strong winds may also cause serious damage to buildings and other infrastructure.<br>• Hurricanes are difficult to predict/forecast: timing, tracks and strength. Coastal areas may therefore be unprepared.<br>• Global climate change, and rise in sea levels, may result in an increase in hurricane frequency and intensity, and requires global effort.<br>• Both rural and urban population pressures are increasing on vulnerable coastal margins, many of which are low-lying, and may be below sea-level.<br>• Hurricanes often affect relatively poor countries – they cannot afford to build/maintain adequate defenses against flooding; warning systems may be inadequate; problems of poor communication systems.<br>• Costly and difficult to improve poorly constructed buildings and infrastructure.<br>• Poorer communities may lack resilience and preparation, which are difficult to overcome.<br>• Government and local planning may be inadequate, partly due to unforeseen power of some hurricanes.<br>Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3), which examines processes and systems affecting the level of impacts in different coastal places. Also, the varying power of different stakeholders may be examined. Another approach might be to examine how it can be challenging to reduce impacts over longer time scales.",

    question: "To what extent does personal affluence affect people’s participation in leisure activities?",
    answer: "• There has been a significant growth in participation in different types of leisure activities (sport and tourism) in recent years.<br>• Participation is partly linked to personal affluence, in addition to a variety of other factors including gender, ethnicity and religion and stage in lifecycle.<br>• Ability/knowledge to access leisure activities (including those that are free/low-cost), social media use, awareness of promotional campaigns by groups/local councils.<br>• Personal affluence/disposable income is a key factor affecting participation in sports and tourism, including the type of activity, cost, and duration. “Affluence” can include time, in addition to wealth.<br>• Stage in lifecycle (e.g. older/retired people or younger people with families) will affect participation in different types of activities. Ageing populations often have increased leisure time and more disposable incomes.<br>• Place of residence (e.g. rural or urban/ inner city or suburbs), which is partly influenced by affluence and perhaps stage in lifecycle, affects access to different types of leisure activity and sports facilities.",

    answer: "• Festivals held in rural locations may be music, sporting or religious, attracting large numbers of visitors from a wide catchment area.<br>• Geographic impacts may be both negative and positive, and affect places and people at different scales from local to regional.<br>• Environmental impacts might include noise pollution and congestion, exceeding the carrying capacity, pressure on water supplies, waste disposal and damage to ecosystems.<br>• There may be positive impacts such as promoting green issues/sustainability, encouraging use of recyclable materials at the site, promoting conservation, donating tents to charity after the event.<br>• Economic impacts include increased demand for accommodation and food, greater spending in the local area, increased local employment, improvements to infrastructure.<br>• Travel to festivals is a major issue, causing congestion on surrounding roads and settlements. Land may not be suitable for farming for some time after the festival.<br>• Different stakeholders will have varying perspectives on the costs and benefits of how rural areas are used for festivals.<br>• Impacts, for example disposal of all types of waste, should be managed in a sustainable way, so that benefits outweigh the costs of festivals. Many of the impacts are temporary/seasonal.",

    answer: "• Sphere of influence, or catchment area, of facilities will be affected by the threshold and range of populations utilizing the facilities.<br>• Threshold populations for low-order facilities such as local gyms are usually low; they will be more frequent and have a small sphere of influence.<br>• National parks are in designated areas of outstanding natural beauty which generate their own sphere of influence.<br>• High-order facilities, such as sports stadiums, will have high threshold populations and a large sphere of influence.<br>• Accessibility is also important; facilities with good communications links have larger spheres of influence. Local gyms may be accessible to a large urban population, in both city centres and suburban areas.<br>• Stadia of wealthy sports teams with high reputations have larger spheres than smaller, poorer teams.<br>• Multi-purpose stadia will host a variety of different events and people from a wide area.<br>• Media has a powerful influence, extending the sphere of influence to national and international scales.<br>• Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3) which examines reasons for variations in spheres of influence for different types of leisure facility.<br>• How human and physical factors shape places into sites of leisure.<br>• Another approach might be to examine why differences in economic and political power influence distribution and variety of leisure facilities.",
