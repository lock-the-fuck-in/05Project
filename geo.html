                year: 2024,
                paper: 1,
                answer: "Warm ocean provides the energy for a storm to develop<br>â€¢ Coriolis effect / rotation of the Earth allows storms to spin in the tropics.<br>â€¢ Low atmospheric pressure.<br>â€¢ High levels of insolation keeping water warm."

                year: 2024,
                paper: 1,
                answer: "â€¢ Mangroves may mean the villages/fishing communities/ tourist resorts are more protected from hurricanes / tropical cyclones [1], as mangroves absorb wave energy [1] and dissipate the force of the storm [1].<br>â€¢ Fishermen value the mangrove swamps due to the habitat and biodiversity / various types of fish [1] for example, prawn fishing in Thailand [1] so they can gain income / profit from their catches [1].<br>â€¢ They provide breeding and feeding grounds for fish<br>â€¢ They provide natural filters of run-off from farms and sewage<br>â€¢ They potentially help with stabilization of shorelines / prevention of erosion."

                year: 2024,
                paper: 1,
                answer: "â€¢ Overfishing has led to the depletion of fish stocks (e.g. cod, tuna) and is unsustainable.<br>â€¢ Fish stocks have collapsed in some ocean areas, such as the North Sea and Grand Banks of Newfoundland.<br>â€¢ Establishment of conservation areas (Marine Protected Areas) to manage fishing, allow fish stocks to recover, and protect marine biodiversity. Also, important scientific research is carried out.<br>â€¢ Success of MPAs is varied, due to weak regulation and controls, conflict over ownership and rights in ocean areas. Fishing permitted in some MPAs; illegal fishing and bottom dredging continue.<br>â€¢ Conservation areas may conserve fish stocks for the future, but those who rely on fishing for their food/livelihood may not be in favour in the short-medium term.<br>â€¢ Conservation areas may have limited success in protecting fish stocks; other strategies, including quotas and aquaculture, may be required."

                year: 2024,
                paper: 1,
                answer: "â€¢ Wind and vegetation play a vital role in the formation of coastal sand dunes.<br>â€¢ Other factors are also important, including constructive wave action, a plentiful supply of sand, wide, flat beaches (which allows the sand to dry out) and strong on-shore winds.<br>â€¢ Vegetation traps the sand, anchors the shifting wind-blown sand, allowing more sand to accumulate.<br>â€¢ Over time, more dunes will form in front of the existing dunes and plant succession occurs on the older, inland dunes. The development of vegetation is accompanied by soil formation and a complex ecosystem.<br>â€¢ Human activity may destroy vegetation, causing erosion of the dunes. Re-planting of vegetation and restrictions on access for people are important in dune conservation<br>â€¢ Wind and vegetation work together in the development of sand dunes."

                year: 2023,
                paper: 1,
                answer: "For example, weathering [1] from cycles of wetting/drying weakening the rock and making it more liable to collapse. [1]<br>Accept salt, biological, chemical, or physical weathering but not marine process weathering/erosion e.g. hydraulic action by waves.<br>Other subaerial processes include:<br>â€¢ Mass movement<br>â€¢ Running water<br>â€¢ Wind"

                year: 2023,
                paper: 1,
                answer: "(i) A raised beach is above the current sea level [1]. This is formed by ice melting [1], leading to uplift of the land (rebound) when the pressure is released [1].<br>(ii) A fjord is a glacial valley flooded (by the sea) [1] caused when a rise in sea level takes place [1] after ice melts [1]."

                year: 2023,
                paper: 1,
                answer: "â€¢ Abiotic resources include minerals, oil and gas (Do not credit biotic resources, such as fish).<br>â€¢ Increasing demand for resources below ocean floors is a potential cause of international conflict.<br>â€¢ Ownership of ocean areas may be in doubt and contested at the national and international scale.<br>â€¢ Management of conflict involves resolving contested ownership, international laws and allocation of territorial rights/limits which may reduce conflict/make conflict less likely.<br>â€¢ Stakeholders include national governments and transnational mining corporations, and/or international organizations such as the UN and NGOs."

                year: 2023,
                paper: 1,
                answer: "â€¢ Hurricanes cause serious flooding in coastal areas, due to both heavy, prolonged rain, and storm surges caused by strong winds. Strong winds may also cause serious damage to buildings and other infrastructure.<br>â€¢ Hurricanes are difficult to predict/forecast: timing, tracks and strength. Coastal areas may therefore be unprepared.<br>â€¢ Global climate change, and rise in sea levels, may result in an increase in hurricane frequency and intensity, and requires global effort.<br>â€¢ Both rural and urban population pressures are increasing on vulnerable coastal margins, many of which are low-lying, and may be below sea-level.<br>â€¢ Hurricanes often affect relatively poor countries â€“ they cannot afford to build/maintain adequate defenses against flooding; warning systems may be inadequate; problems of poor communication systems."
