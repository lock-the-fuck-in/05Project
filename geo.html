    question: "Explain two reasons why stakeholders value mangrove swamps.",
    answer: "•Mangroves may mean the villages/fishing communities/ tourist resorts are more protected from hurricanes / tropical cyclones, as mangroves absorb wave energy and dissipate the force of the storm.<br>•Fishermen value the mangrove swamps due to the habitat and biodiversity / various types of fish for example, prawn fishing in Thailand so they can gain income/profit from their catches.<br>• They provide breeding and feeding grounds for fish<br>• They provide natural filters of run-off from farms and sewage<br>• They potentially help with stabilization of shorelines/prevention of erosion.",

    topic: "Oceans and coastal margins",
    question: "Examine the contribution of conservation areas to the management of oceanic fish stocks.",
    answer: "• Overfishing has led to the depletion of fish stocks (e.g. cod, tuna) and is unsustainable.<br>• Fish stocks have collapsed in some ocean areas, such as the North Sea and Grand Banks of Newfoundland.<br>• Establishment of conservation areas (Marine Protected Areas) to manage fishing, allow fish stocks to recover and protect marine biodiversity. Also, important scientific research is carried out.<br>• Success of MPAs is varied, due to weak regulation and controls, and conflict over ownership and rights in ocean areas. Fishing is permitted in some MPAs; illegal fishing and bottom dredging continue.<br>• Conservation areas may conserve fish stocks for the future, but those who rely on fishing for their food/livelihood may not be in favour in the short-medium term.<br>• Conservation areas may have limited success in protecting fish stocks; other strategies, including quotas and aquaculture, may be required.",

    paper: 1,
    topic: "Oceans and coastal margins",
    question: "Examine the roles of wind and vegetation in the development of coastal sand dunes.",
    answer: "• Wind and vegetation play a vital role in the formation of coastal sand dunes.<br>• Other factors are also important, including constructive wave action, a plentiful supply of sand, wide, flat beaches (which allows the sand to dry out) and strong on-shore winds.<br>• Vegetation traps the sand, and anchors the shifting wind-blown sand, allowing more sand to accumulate.<br>• Over time, more dunes will form in front of the existing dunes and plant succession occurs on the older, inland dunes. The development of vegetation is accompanied by soil formation and a complex ecosystem.<br>• Human activity may destroy vegetation, causing erosion of the dunes. Re-planting of vegetation and restrictions on access for people are important in dune conservation<br>• Wind and vegetation work together in the development of sand dunes.",

    answer: "Weathering from cycles of wetting/drying weakens the rock and makes it more liable to collapse. Accept salt, biological, chemical, or physical weathering but not marine process weathering/erosion e.g. hydraulic action by waves. Other subaerial processes include:<br>• Mass movement<br>• Running water<br>• Wind",

    year: 2023,
    paper: 1,
    topic: "Oceans and coastal margins",
    question: "Examine how the increasing demand for abiotic resources in ocean areas may be a source of international conflict.",
    answer: "• Abiotic resources include minerals, oil and gas (Do not credit biotic resources, such as fish).<br>• Increasing demand for resources below ocean floors is a potential cause of international conflict.<br>• Ownership of ocean areas may be in doubt and contested at the national and international scale.<br>• Management of conflict involves resolving contested ownership, international laws and allocation of territorial rights/limits which may reduce conflict/make conflict less likely.<br>• Stakeholders include national governments and transnational mining corporations, and/or international organizations such as the UN and NGOs. Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3) which examines a variety of reasons for international conflict, and the roles/power of different stakeholders, in different places. Another approach might be to examine the varying perspectives on the effectiveness of management strategies.",

    paper: 1,
    topic: "Oceans and coastal margins",
    question: "Examine why it is difficult to reduce the impacts of hurricanes on coastal places and people",
    answer: "• Hurricanes cause serious flooding in coastal areas, due to both heavy, prolonged rain, and storm surges caused by strong winds. Strong winds may also cause serious damage to buildings and other infrastructure.<br>• Hurricanes are difficult to predict/forecast: timing, tracks and strength. Coastal areas may therefore be unprepared.<br>• Global climate change, and rise in sea levels, may result in an increase in hurricane frequency and intensity, and requires global effort.<br>• Both rural and urban population pressures are increasing on vulnerable coastal margins, many of which are low-lying, and may be below sea-level.<br>• Hurricanes often affect relatively poor countries – they cannot afford to build/maintain adequate defenses against flooding; warning systems may be inadequate; problems of poor communication systems.<br>• Costly and difficult to improve poorly constructed buildings and infrastructure.<br>• Poorer communities may lack resilience and preparation, which are difficult to overcome.<br>• Government and local planning may be inadequate, partly due to unforeseen power of some hurricanes.<br>Good answers may be well-structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3), which examines processes and systems affecting the level of impacts in different coastal places. Also, the varying power of different stakeholders may be examined. Another approach might be to examine how it can be challenging to reduce impacts over longer time scales.",

    question: "To what extent has urban growth been accompanied by improvements in infrastructure? ",
    answer: "Possible applied themes (AO2) demonstrating knowledge and understanding (AO1):<br>• Provision of basic infrastructure (e.g. power, transport, IT communications, waste, water) is essential to people’s quality of life and economic growth<br>• Infrastructure is costly to install, maintain and improve. So, often does not keep pace with urban growth<br>• Rapid urban growth, especially in low-income countries, is often not accompanied by infrastructure improvement, resulting in power failures, poor communications, poor quality water and sanitation. Living standards suffer as a result<br>• In established cities, infrastructure must change and upgrade to meet demands of economic growth and rising living standards. Wealthier areas often fare better than poorer areas – resulting in regional inequalities at different scales<br>• Infrastructure improvements are also necessary for the development of sustainable cities.<br>Good answers may be well structured (AO4) and may additionally offer a critical evaluation (AO3) of the statement which shows understanding of the issues surrounding infrastructure development, the power, and perspectives of different stakeholders, and how this varies between different places and scales. Another approach might be to examine how the relationship between urban growth and infrastructure may vary over time, perhaps resulting in a more sustainable future.",
